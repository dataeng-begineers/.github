# Welcome to Data Engineering Beginner Projects

This is the official page for our beginner-friendly data engineering community. Here, anyone can learn, contribute, and collaborate on small data engineering projects.

## About the Organization

Our goal is to help beginners get hands-on experience with real-world data engineering tasks. We focus on practical learning using Python, SQL, Airflow, DBT, Postgres, Kafka, and more.

We encourage participation from everyone: students, junior engineers, or anyone curious about data engineering.

## Projects

Our projects are designed to be simple and approachable. Some examples:








Each project includes sample data, setup instructions, and step-by-step guidance.

## How to Get Involved

- Browse our projects and choose one that fits your skill level.  
- Follow the instructions in each project’s README to set up your local environment.  
- Test the sample scripts and try small improvements.  
- Share your work by creating a Pull Request.  
- Ask questions or give feedback in Discussions or Issues.

## Tips for Beginners

- Start small: work with Python and SQL projects first.  
- Take it step by step: load data → transform → save → schedule.  
- Use provided sample data and scripts.  
- Don’t hesitate to ask questions; the community is here to help.
